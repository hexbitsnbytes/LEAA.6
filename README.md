Scripts and projects                    |

You will find a collection of school projects alongside some personal experimentation, espicially with BASH and PYTHON.
This is also used as a way to track pratical exercises and to collaborate with other students. 

N.B: I encourage everyone to get accustomed with GIT and GITHUB as they appear to be useful tools in the industry.
